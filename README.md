## Tech Stack

- **React 19** — component-based UI

- **Recharts** — data visualizations
- **Lucide React** — icon library
- **React Hot Toast** — notification system

---

## Features

### Core Requirements
- **Dashboard Overview** — summary cards with animated counters, 6-month bar chart, spending donut chart
- **Transactions Section** — full transaction list with search, filter by type/category, and sort by date/amount
- **Role Based UI** — switch between Viewer (read only) and Admin (add, edit, delete transactions) using the role dropdown
- **Insights Section** — top spending category, month-over-month comparison table, category breakdown with progress bars
- **State Management** — centralized via React Context API managing transactions, filters, and role

### Optional Enhancements
- **Animated number counters** on stat cards for a premium feel
- **CSV Export** — download filtered transactions as a `.csv` file
- **Toast notifications** — feedback on every add, edit, and delete action
- **Gradient bar charts** with reference line showing average expenses
- **Interactive donut chart** — hover pulls out segments, center shows category total
- **Empty state handling** — friendly message when no transactions match filters
- **Responsive design** — works on all screen sizes

## Role Based UI

| Feature | Viewer | Admin |
|---|---|---|
| View dashboard | ✅ | ✅ |
| View transactions | ✅ | ✅ |
| View insights | ✅ | ✅ |
| Add transaction | ❌ | ✅ |
| Edit transaction | ❌ | ✅ |
| Delete transaction | ❌ | ✅ |
| Export CSV | ✅ | ✅ |

Switch roles using the **Role** dropdown in the top right corner.

## State Management Approach

All application state lives in a single `AppContext` using React's built-in Context API and `useMemo` for derived state:

- `transactions` — source of truth for all transaction data
- `filteredTransactions` — derived from transactions + active filters
- `categorySpending` — derived for chart data
- `summary` — derived income, expenses, balance, savings rate
- `role` — controls UI permissions
- `search`, `filterType`, `filterCat`, `sortBy` — filter state

This approach was chosen for simplicity, readability, and to avoid unnecessary dependencies for a project of this scope.

---

## Assumptions Made

- All data is static and mock — no backend or API integration
- "March 2026" is used as the current active month for summary calculations
- Role switching is frontend-only for demonstration purposes
- CSV export applies to currently filtered transactions
